# Histogram_Equalization_and_Specification

This project will demonstrate the Histogram equalization and specification of satellite images for display purposes.
The image taken to execute the code was Landsat-8 of Gangotri region.

All the histograms are plotted to make the understanding of how the algorithm works clear.

Working :

input the **tiff** file of satellite image.
input the 3 band numbers to apply the operation on and display the composite image.

in histogram specification, an image of high contrast will also be asked.
